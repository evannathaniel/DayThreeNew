//struct Structures and classes in Swift have many things in common. Both can:Define properties to store values, Define methods to provide functionality, Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax, Define initializers to set up their initial state, Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation, Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind

struct Person {
    var clothes: String
    var shoes: String
}

let taylor = Person(clothes: "T-shirts", shoes: "sneakers")
let other = Person(clothes: "short skirts", shoes: "high heels")

//class -> Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another. *Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime. *Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned. *Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

class Bike {

  // properties with no default values
  var name: String
  var gear: Int

  // assign value using initializer
  init(name: String, gear: Int){
    self.name = name
    self.gear = gear
  }
}

// object of Person with custom initializer
var bike1 = Bike(name: "BMX Bike", gear: 2)

print("Name: \(bike1.name) and Gear: \(bike1.gear)")

  // properties and method of the parent class
